An open source hybrid mobile app to store all your loyalty cards in one place :)
This is an ionic application and is specifically designed for Android and the apk is available 
under the repos releases. If you do not trust the apk you can generate your own and you can develop on the source as well.
This app does not have any warranty or guarantee. No security mechanisms have been incorporated into the app yet and you should not store
sensitive information like credit/debit cards. This app was simply created to keep all your loyalty cards in one app instead of carrying 
them around with you everywhere you go.
